  This paper presents Lunar Twins, the first large language models specifically designed for lunar exploration. The system includes the Chang’e and Yutu models, introduces a collaborative multi-agent workflow (Lunar_GenData), and establishes the first specialized lunar dataset integrating data from the Chang’e missions. Extensive experiments show that Lunar Twins significantly outperform comparable models in domain expertise and hint at embodied intelligence potential.
