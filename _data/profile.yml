    My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>astronomy and artificial intelligence</strong>, focusing on multimodal perception, large language models, space mission instruction parsing, and autonomous reasoning for space applications. I conduct astronomical research under the supervision of <a href="https://nao.cas.cn/jypy/ds/bsds/202204/t20220406_6986053.html" target="_blank">Prof. Nan Li</a> at the <a href="https://nao.cas.cn/" target="_blank">National Astronomical Observatories (NAOC)</a> and <a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0072662" target="_blank">Prof. Ning An</a> at the <a href="http://www.cho.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Changchun Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>.

    I am currently a research intern at <a href="https://thfl.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">The Future Laboratory, Tsinghua University</a>, where I am working on developing large-scale lunar language models and intelligent systems for lunar exploration. Previously, I interned at the <a href="https://nao.cas.cn/" target="_blank">National Astronomical Observatories, CAS</a> and the <a href="https://ess.sustech.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Department of Earth and Space Sciences, SUSTech</a>, gaining hands-on experience in cutting-edge astronomical and space science projects.
